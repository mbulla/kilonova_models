# kilonova_models
Kilonova models computed using POSSIS (see Bulla 2019, MNRAS, 489, 5037 for an outline of the code).

Feel free to use these models, referecing the relevant papers (see citations.bib in each model directory)

Note that some models are used in different publications and thus can be found in multiple directories.
