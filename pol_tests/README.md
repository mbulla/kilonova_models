# Validation tests for polarization

These includes code validation tests for polarization. 

The tests are computed assuming the geometry described in Hillier (1994) as explained in Bulla, Sim & Kromer (2015). The geometry is shown in geometry.pdf.

# OPTICALLY-THICK CASE 
pol_tau.pdf shows Fig. 5 of Bulla, Sim & Kromer (2015), where the results from POSSIS (symbols) are compared to the numerical simulations in Hillier (1994, lines). See Section 3.1 of Bulla, Sim & Kromer (2015) for more details.

#OPTICALLY-THIN CASE
pol_thin.pdf shows polarization vs inclination angle for three different cases where the averaged optical depth is equal to tau = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2. The solid line is the analytic solution from Brown & McLean (1977) for the geometry assumed.
